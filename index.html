			<h1>For People Who Demand Better</h1>
			<p>Families need good health more than ever.<br><br>

Real science. The best ingredients. And great taste. <br><br>

Sounds simple, right? Sure. But behind these simple concepts are years of scientific research, 
innovation, and design. Areas that companies take 
shortcuts in - But not us. <br><br>

That's why 70,000+ people made the switch to First Day. <br><br>  

Stop settling for the sugar bombs disguised as vitamins. or the outdated formulas filled with unnecessary fillers. <br><br>

Demand Better.</p>
